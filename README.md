# ButtonBoxV2
Buttonbox using Button Matrix and 3 Encoders


A button box with up to 24 Buttons and includes push button rotary encoders as buttons 18-24 using an Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro to host a controller for the button box. 
You will also need to add the following libraries:
1. Joystick library from Matthew Heironimus (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) 
2. "RotaryEncoder" library by Matthias Hertel
3. "Keypad" library by the Arduimo Community.

In addition to this you would need: Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro 5v 16mhz a small breadboard to place it on if you don't want to solder the cables onto the board directly a enclosure to host the buttons of your choice. 
I just used the following switches :
1. 4 miniature momentary switches (https://www.jaycar.com.au/red-miniature-pushbutton-spst-momentary-action-125v-1a-rating/p/SP0710)
2. 4 round (https://www.jaycar.com.au/small-black-spst-n-o-momentary-action/p/SP0700) 
2. 4 square (https://www.jaycar.com.au/pushbutton-push-on-momentary-spst-red-actuator/p/SP0716) 
3. 3 push button rotary switches https://www.jaycar.com.au/rotary-encoder-with-pushbutton/p/SR1230
4. 1 toggle switch (for the ignition - https://www.jaycar.com.au/spst-standard-toggle-switch/p/ST0570) 
5. 1. Large Momentary switch (Start Button - https://www.jaycar.com.au/engine-start-switch/p/SP0773)

Optional
1. Flip Cover for ignition - https://www.jaycar.com.au/missile-launch-style-toggle-switch-cover-carbon-fibre-appearance/p/ST0584
